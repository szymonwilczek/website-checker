Always remember to be safe in Internet! Although, I know it can be difficult in our times.

To help you, I create simple, quick and understandable software in Go for everyone using net package.

# Prerequisites

**1.** Installed `Go` language. If you don't have installed it, you can do that [here.](https://go.dev/dl/)

**2.** Installed `git`.

**3.** Installed dependecies from [go.sum](https://github.com/szymonwilczek/website-checker/blob/master/go.sum) file.
  
  *You can simply do that by typing in terminal of downloaded zip code `git clone [link]` one by one.*

# Usage

Run by using `go build szymo.go` or `go run szymo.go` in terminal.

Then only paste addres to site (**can** include username, password, query, fragments, etc).
